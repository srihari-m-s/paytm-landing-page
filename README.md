# paytm-landing-page
A clone of the **[Paytm](https://paytm.com/)** landing page built using React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The original Landing page has many sections showing the different features of the Paytm application. I have tried to replicate the design of the page here. 

I have used React so that the code for each sections of the page could be compartmentalized. That makes making changes or editing the sections themselves simple. This is a replication of only the landing page. I have divided the page into 10 components.

1. A Navigation component, 
2. 8 Section components,
3. and a Footer component.

I have used only CSS for styling.
